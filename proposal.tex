\section{Introduction}

Every programming language has its own way of dealing with types of expressions. Some of them require the programmer to specify types, this is, whether it is a number, a string, or something else. Others infer types just by looking at the expressions, and others simply don't know what is the type of the expression. The way a language determines the type of its expressions is called a type system, and there are two main approaches; static and dynamic type systems.

A static type system checks and determines the type of each expression before running the program, and lets the user run it only if every expression has a correct type.
On the other hand, a dynamic type system checks the type of the expression during runtime, inserting checks to ensure that operations between values can be applied (it usually does not make sense to add a number to a string).

%Every approach has its weaknesess and advantages. A strong static type system can ensure that there will be no type error during runtime, but at cost of programmers time, because its more time comsuming to write a program where every expression has to have a correct type.
%A dynamic type system allow the programmer to write programs faster, but at cost of reliability and robustness.

A programming language with a static or a dynamic type system have its strengths and weaknesses.
If you have a static type system, you can guarantee that there will not be runtime type errors, but from the perspective of a programmer, a simple solution can become tedious because of the rigurosity of the language.
In contrast, if you have a dynamic type system, it becomes easier to write programs, but you may encounter type errors at runtime (losing reliability) and your programs may be slower due to runtime type checking.

The idea of combining both worlds has been around for a long time, and many attempts has been made to accomplish such goal.
Siek and Taha in 2006 \cite{Siek2006GradualTF} introduced \textit{gradual typing};
a type system that lets the programmer choose between static and dynamic typing in the same language, by letting them choose which terms to annotate, and which to leave without a defined type.
When first defined, a solution based on intuition was presented.
It consisted of a $\lambda$-calculus ($\lambda^{?}_{\rightarrow}$) that introduced the \textit{unknown} type, which refers to an unannotated term.
This means that statically there could be terms which the type system is not sure what its real type is.
For example, let's introduce the following program in a language with $\lambda$'s, \textit{int}'s and \textit{bool}'s:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Lambda]
let foo(x: int) : int = x + 1 in foo(1);
\end{lstlisting}

This program will not throw an static type error, because the function foo expects an \textit{int} and an \textit{int} is given.
Now, let's introduce a similar program, but in a gradual language:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Lambda]
let foo(x: ?) : int = x + 1 in foo(1);
\end{lstlisting}

In this version, we declared the argument of the function \textit{foo} as \textit{unknown} (denoted by $?$).
What Siek and Taha \cite{Siek2006GradualTF} intuited was that this program should be accepted by a gradual type system, because declaring the argument $x$ as $?$ means that $x$ can be any type, thus it can be an int.

Now, what happens when we have a program like the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Lambda]
let foo(x: ?) : int = x + 1 in foo(true);
\end{lstlisting}

In this case, the program also should be accepted by the type system, but it should throw a type error at runtime because a boolean can not be added to an int.

Now that we can have $?$, then the type system can not expect every term to have its type equal to the expected type to accept a program.
Thus, \textit{Type Consistency}, a new relation between types, was instroduced.
In short terms, every type is consistent with $?$ and with itself, and is not with a type different from itself.
A gradual type system expect types to be consistent to each other in order to accept a program.
% In this sense we could say that a gradual type system takes care about all the typed parts of a program, and leaves the untyped parts to the dynamic rules of the language.

This relaxation introduces the posibility of dynamic type error, therefore, the dynamic part of the language should take care of them.

%Tengo dudas en esta parte (language dynamics). Preguntarle al profe como funciona exactamente, para asi explicarlo mejor en caso de ser necesario
For the dynamic part of the language, a translation is made from $\lambda^{?}_{\rightarrow}$ into an intermediate $\lambda$-calculus with implicit casts $\lambda^{}_{\rightarrow}$.
In simple terms, this intermediate language adds casts at some points of the evaluation to assert that the type of the gotten term is consistent with what was expected.
If they are not, then a \textit{CastError} is thrown.


This construction had type safety proven, which means that this language will have no type violations at runtime; they are caught staticaly or dynamically.
In other words, well typed programs will not have uncontrolled type errors.

% This definition had some important proof related to it.
% It had type safety proven, which means that this language will have no type violations at runtime; they are caught staticaly or dynamically.
% In other words, well typed programs will not have type error.
% Also important, a theorem that stated that fully annotated programs in $\lambda^{?}_{\rightarrow}$
% behaved the same way as in the simply typed counter part of $\lambda^{?}_{\rightarrow}$.
%
% Although this work captured the escence of gradual typing, 

Siek et al in 2015 \cite{siek_et_al:LIPIcs.SNAPL.2015.274} realized that a more formal characterization was required in order to define what gradual typing is, because the term was being used to refer to any integration between static and dynamic typing.
They introduced the a new formal property called the \textit{gradual guarantee}, that in simple words states that is a gradually typed program is well typed, then removing type annotations from it should; 1) not affect its well typeness, 2) not affect in the result it gives (the value given by the original version should be equivalent to the one with removed type anotations).

Other criteria discussed in this paper state that a gradually typed language should include the untyped and typed versions of it, and that, when a program is fully typed in the gradual version, it should behave the same as in the typed version.
This also applies to the fully untyped programs and the untyped version on the language.


What we have discussed until this point has been the pilars of what a gradually typed language is and how it should behave, and ilustrated it with a simple lambda calculus.
What if we want to create a gradually typed language with real world applications, including features modern mainstream languages have, like Python or JavaScript?

%Parrafo para mostrar las features en las que se a logrado aplicar gradual typing

A lot of effort has been made to accomplish such goal, and a lot of language features has been succesfuly gradualized, like ...

Just like Siek and Taha in 2006, most of these gradual type systems have been intuitively designed, and it becomes even more challenging as the type system becomes more sophisticated.

In 2015, Garcia et al. \cite{10.1145/2914770.2837670} introduced Abstracting Gradual Typing (AGT), a framework to gradualize static type systems that is based on abstract interpretation.
Given a static type system,
